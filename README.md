# BugFest
A version of the game "Bug Fest" using the BASYS3 board and the VGA monitor connected to it. The Bug Fest game involves controlling a player character called the "slug," which flies between moving platforms in an attempt to catch green bugs. The game ends if the slug falls into the pond below or is pushed against the left wall by a platform.
